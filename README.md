### **BLE-Based Gyroscope Controlled Motor System**

This project demonstrates a **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**-based system to control motor movements using gyroscope data streamed from a mobile device via the **Adafruit Bluefruit Connect app**. The system parses gyroscope data packets, validates them, and uses the parsed values to control a motorized platform's movements.

---

## **Features**

- **BLE Communication**:
  - Implements a robust BLE communication protocol using the Adafruit Bluefruit LE UART Friend module.
  - Reads, validates, and parses gyroscope data packets in real-time.

- **Integration with Bluefruit Connect App**:
  - Utilizes the **Bluefruit Connect app** (available for iOS and Android) to stream gyroscope readings from the phone.
  - Leverages the phone's gyroscope to dynamically control motorized movements.

- **Gyroscope Data Handling**:
  - Parses the gyroscope data format specified by Adafruit:
    - Prefix: `!G`
    - Data format: `[â€˜!â€™] [â€˜Gâ€™] [float x] [float y] [float z] [CRC]`
    - Each packet contains X, Y, and Z axis values as 32-bit floats, followed by a single-byte checksum (CRC).
  - Validates the checksum (CRC) to ensure data integrity.

- **Motor Control**:
  - Controls motor actions (forward, backward, left, right, stop) based on gyroscope data.
  - Integrates Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for precise motor speed control.

- **Debugging and Logging**:
  - Outputs raw BLE data in hexadecimal format for debugging.
  - Logs parsed gyroscope data (`X`, `Y`, `Z`) and motor actions via UART.

## **Raw Data Format**

This project is designed to handle BLE data packets sent in the following format, as defined by the **Adafruit Bluefruit Connect app** documentation:

- **Prefix**:
  - `!` (0x21): Start of packet
  - `G` (0x47): Identifies gyroscope data

- **Payload**:
  - `float x` (4 bytes): X-axis value in radians/second
  - `float y` (4 bytes): Y-axis value in radians/second
  - `float z` (4 bytes): Z-axis value in radians/second

- **Checksum**:
  - 1-byte CRC: Computed as the inverted sum of all previous bytes in the packet.

**Example BLE Packet**:
```
Raw Hexadecimal: 21 47 96 E9 71 3D 93 A8 18 3D C7 A8 08 3B 28
Parsed Values:
  X: 0.91
  Y: 0.76
  Z: -0.53
CRC: 0x28 (valid)
```

## **System Workflow**

1. **Bluefruit Connect App as Controller**:
   - The phone streams gyroscope data (`X`, `Y`, `Z`) via BLE to the microcontroller.
   - Gyroscope readings are captured when the app's "Controller" mode is active.

2. **BLE Data Reception**:
   - The system continuously receives data packets over BLE.
   - Data packets are validated and checked for integrity using CRC.

3. **Gyroscope Parsing**:
   - Extracts the gyroscope's `X`, `Y`, and `Z` axis values as 32-bit floating-point numbers.

4. **Motor Control**:
   - Based on the gyroscope values:
     - Moves forward/backward depending on the Y-axis tilt.
     - Turns left/right based on the X-axis tilt.
     - Stops if the X and Y values are within a neutral threshold.

5. **Debugging**:
   - Prints raw BLE data and parsed float values to the UART console for monitoring.
