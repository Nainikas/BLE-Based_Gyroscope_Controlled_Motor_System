# BLE-Based_Gyroscope_Controlled_Motor_System
This project demonstrates a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-based system to control motor movements using gyroscope data from a BLE-enabled device, such as the Adafruit Bluefruit LE UART Friend module. The system parses gyroscope data packets, validates them, and uses the parsed values to control a motorized platform's movements.
